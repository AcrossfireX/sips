## Meeting Notes

The governance CAB discussed SIP-022 and the supporting materials, and concluded that the SIP should be approved given the following:

- the bug could cause a catastrophic failure of the Stacks blockchain
- swift action is necessary to prevent the crash from happening
- conducting a vote would delay the hard fork and increase the risk of failure

Quoting from the draft SIP discussing [catastrophic blockchain failures and recovery](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/feat/sip011-catastrophic-failure-recovery/sips/sip-011/sip-011-catastrophic-failure-recovery.md#changing-existing-network-messages):

> If the catastrophic failure can only be remedied by changing the way nodes handle an existing message, such that the change renders the node incompatible with the network (i.e. unable to effectively participate in block synchronization, relaying, and/or mining), then the bugfix will require rolling out two concurrent versions of the network that share the same chainstate for a time in order to allow people running old nodes a chance to upgrade. The deadline to upgrade (and the deadline at which the old, buggy code-paths will cease to be supported) will be enforced programmatically by new nodes, and will be measured in burnchain block heights.

The proposed fix satisfies the requirements above by taking the following actions:

- disable `stack-increase` for solo stackers
- reset the `total-ustx` values in the `reward-cycle-pox-address-list` used to track solo stackers
- set flags so the new network cannot interact with the old network, creating a clean break in chainstate
- allowing for the existing Stacks 2.1 chainstate to be used in migration to Stacks 2.2
- setting a burnchain (Bitcoin) block height for activation of the hard fork

## Vote Outcome(s)

- Jason Schrader: yes, see note
- Harold Davis: yes
- Zero Authority: yes
- Orlando Cosme: yes
- Juliet Oberding: yes

The Governance CAB unanimously approves SIP-022.
